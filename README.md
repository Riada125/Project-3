## <span style="font-family:Courier New">Overview </span>

The Kitchen is a full-stack app that includes a RESTful API built with Express, MonogoDB and NodeJS and a React Front-end. 

The concept was to build an app that asked users if they wanted to dine-in or eat-out and then provide them with options based on their decision. 

The dine-in portion of the website allows users to search recipes from our database, it also allows logged in users to add their own recipes, much like a virtual recipe book and the user can also have shopping lists for each recipe emailed to their registered email address.

The eat-out section gives users details about London restaurants from our own seeded database. 

Users also have a profile page which displays their favourite recipes and restaurants. 

This is the third project which I completed during my time in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.

### <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="planning">Planning</span>

We decided to create an app that focused on food, either cooking at home or dining out. We wanted our page to have a strong amount of content and realised by choosing something like recipes we could create an expansive database of our own fairly easily so that the website would look full of content, rather than relying on an external API or relying on user input. 

We spent an afternoon mapping out our models and the user experience, for both logged-in and logged-out users and wire-framed our intentions. 

Much of our thinking was initially based around user choice - what time of day was it? What did they want to eat? Did they want to cook? 

<img src=Screenshots/Wireframes.jpg width=700> 

As the project deadline loomed, we pared back the choice element and made it a simple option on the landing page. 

### <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="back">Back-End</span>

**<ins>Models</ins>**

We specified four models which utilise a Mongoose Schema class. 

A user:

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number },
  image: { type: String },
  dietary: { type: [String] },
  favouriteRestaurants: { type: [Object] },
  favouriteRecipes: { type: [Object] }
}
```

A restaurant:

```js
const restaurantSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  location: { type: String, required: true },
  image: { type: [String], required: true },
  category: { type: [String], required: true },
  cuisine: { type: String },
  type: { type: [String] },
  dietary: { type: [String] },
  postcode: { type: [String], required: true },
  priceRange: { type: String, required: true },
  link: { type: String, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  comments: [commentSchema]
}, {
  timestamps: true
})
```

and a Recipe:

```js
const recipeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  author: { type: String, required: true },
  about: { type: String },
  ingredients: { type: [String], required: true },
  method: { type: [String], required: true },
  image: { type: [String], required: true },
  category: { type: [String], required: true },
  cuisine: { type: String },
  type: { type: [String], required: true },
  dietary: { type: [String] },
  serves: { type: String },
  complexity: { type: [String] },
  time: { type: String  },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ] 
}, {
  timestamps: true
})
```

Logged in users can also comment on Recipes and so we also have a comment Schema:

```js
const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  text: { type: String, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
}, {
  timestamps: true
})
```

**<ins>API End-points</ins>**

1. User

  |           	| GET 	| POST 	| PUT 	| DELETE 	|
  |-----------	|-----	|------	|-----	|--------	|
  | /register 	|     	|   x  	|     	|        	|
  | /login    	|     	|   x  	|     	|        	|
  | /profile   	|  x  	|     	|    	|       
  | /profile/edit  	|    	|     	|  x  	|      	|


- `/register` has a post route, where the new user's data is received and stored in the database.

```js
function register(req, res, next) {
  User
    .create(req.body)
    .then(user => res.status(200).json({ message: `Hi ${user.username}! Let's change the way you do food..` })) 
    .catch(next)
}
```


- `/login` also has a single post route. When a valid user's login information is received a JSON Web token is returned and saved to localStorage.

```js
function login(req, res) {
  User
    .findOne({ email: req.body.email }) 
    .then(user => { 
      if (!user || !user.validatePassword(req.body.password)) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }) 
      }
      const token = jwt.sign({ sub: user._id }, secret, { expiresIn: '2h' }) 
      res.status(202).json({ message: `Welcome Back ${user.username}`, user, token })
    }) 
    .catch(() => res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }))
}
```

2. Restaurants

  |                      	| GET 	| POST 	| PUT 	| DELETE 	|
  |----------------------	|-----	|------	|-----	|--------	|
  | /restaurants           	|  x  	|     	|     	|        	|
  | /restaurant/:id 	|  x  	|      	|     	|        	|


- Restaurants simply has two `/get` end-points. For users to view all or individual restaurants from our existing database. 


3. Recipes

 |                      	| GET 	| POST 	| PUT 	| DELETE 	|
  |----------------------	|-----	|------	|-----	|--------	|
  | /recipes           	|  x  	|   x  	|     	|        	|
  | /recipes/:id 	|  x  	|  x    	|   x  	|    x    	|
  /recipes/:id/comments/:commentId          	|    	|    	|     	|     x   	|
    
- Any user can `/get` all recipes and individual recipes:

```js
function index(req, res) {
  Recipe
    .find()
    .populate('user')
    .populate('comments.user')
    .then(recipes => res.status(200).json(recipes))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}

function show(req, res) {
  Recipe
    .findById(req.params.id)
    .populate('comments.user')
    .then(recipe => {
      console.log('My recipe is', recipe.name)
      if (!recipe) res.status(404).json({ message: '404 Not found' })
      else res.status(200).json(recipe)
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}
```

- A registered, logged-in user can also `/post` recipes as well as `/put` and `/delete` any recipes that they have posted.

The below functions all pass through a secure route to ensure that the user is logged in and the latter two functions ensure that the user making the request matches the user who created the recipe. Users cannot see these options on the front-end if unless they are authorised. 

```js
function createRecipe(req, res) {
  req.body.user = req.currentUser
  Recipe
    .create(req.body)
    .then(recipe => res.status(201).json(recipe))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}


function updateRecipe(req, res) {
  Recipe
    .findById(req.params.id)
    .then(recipe => {
      if (!recipe) return res.status(404).json({ message: '404 Not found' })
      if (!req.currentUser._id.equals(recipe.user)) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' })
      return recipe.set(req.body)
    })
    .then(recipe => recipe.save())
    .then(recipe => res.status(202).json(recipe))
}


function removeRecipe(req, res) {
  Recipe
    .findById(req.params.id)
    .then(recipe => {
      if (!recipe) return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Not Found' })
      if (!req.currentUser._id.equals(recipe.user)) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' })
      return recipe.remove()
    })
    .then(() => res.status(200).json({ message: 'Recipe deleted' }))
    .catch(err => console.log(err))
}
```

Users can also comment on recipes and delete their own comments. These functions are similar to those shown above. 



**<ins>Secure Route</ins>**

A number of the API Endpoints need to pass through a secure route to ensure that the user is authorised. An example of how this looks in the router is below:

```js
router.route('/recipes/:id')
  .get(recipes.show)
  .put(secureRoute, recipes.updateRecipe)
  .delete(secureRoute, recipes.removeRecipe)
  .post(secureRoute, recipes.createComment)
```
As you can see, any one can see an individual recipe, but only authorised users can reach the end points that follow the secure route. 

We use JSON Web Token for this. When a user logs in, they are assigned a token:

```js
 const token = jwt.sign({ sub: user._id }, secret, { expiresIn: '2h' }) 
 res.status(202).json({ message: `Welcome Back ${user.username}`, user, token })

```
When the token is received by our front-end, it is saved to local storage:

```js
  static setToken(token) {
    localStorage.setItem('token', token)
  }
```

And we get the token and include it in the header of any of our requests to the API:

```js
  static getToken() {
    return localStorage.getItem('token')
  }
```

Below is how the SecureRoute is setup:

```js
function secureRoute(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.headers.authorization || !req.headers.authorization.startsWith('Bearer')) { 
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' })
  }
	
  const token = req.headers.authorization.replace('Bearer ', '') 
	
  jwt.verify(token, secret, (err, payload) => { 
    if (err) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }) 
    User 
      .findById(payload.sub) 
      .then(user => {
        if (!user) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }) 
        req.currentUser = user
        next() 
      })
      .catch(() => res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }))
  })
}
```

The verification process takes the payload.sub from the User's token and finds the related user. If it exists, it sets the `req.currentUser` to the user making the request, we can then use this in the subsequent endpoints to determine if the user making the request is the same as the user who created the recipe.

**<ins>Hooks</ins>**

This was the first project in which we used React's new Hooks feature. Instead of writing class components, we opted to use the `useState` hook, with `useEffect` in place of `componentDidMount` and `useContext` to share state between components without having to pass props or make repeated calls to our back-end API. 


The `useState` hook is used throughout the project. One example of its use is on the registration page:

```js
 const [data, setData] = useState({})
 
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setData({ ...data, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
    setErrors({})
  }
  
    const postIt = () => {

    axios.post('/api/register', data)
      .then(() => props.history.push('/login'))
      .catch(err => {
        setErrors(err.response.data.errors)
        console.log(err.response.data.errors)
      })
  }
```
 
Above, `useState({})` is setting `data` as an empty object. The handle change function uses `setData` to update the `data` object variable and thus we can then use this data as state in our post to the API.


`useContext` was another helpful Hook for this project. We utilised it to hold the information of the logged-in user across the app so that we didn't have to make repeated calls to the API or pass props through all of our components. 

We have a file called `userContext.js` that creates a context and sets it to a null value:

```js
import { createContext } from 'react'

export const UserContext = createContext(null)
```



We then update the context upon the user's login:

```js

const { setUserInfo } = useContext(UserContext)

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    axios.post('/api/login', data)
      .then(response => {
        Auth.setToken(response.data.token)
        setUserInfo(response.data.user)
        props.history.push('/recipes')
      })

```

 Once a user has successfully logged in, we `setUserInfo` to be the response from the API (the details of the logged in user such as their name, id, profile picture and favourite recipes and restaurants).

With this information saved by `useContext`, the entire app can access it as state without props being passed or with us requiring more calls to the API. 

This is used to our advantage in places like the navbar, where the user's profile name is rendered from `userInfo`.

Another place this is used to our advantage is when a logged-in user navigates to a single recipe page:

```js
        if (userInfo) {
          setInfo(userInfo)
          const alreadyAdded = userInfo.favouriteRecipes.some((recipe) => {
            return recipe._id === newData._id
          })
          setAdded(alreadyAdded)
        }
```

The snipped above is when we return a single recipe from our API. We check the userInfo from `useContext`, if the user has already favourited the recipe, they will be unable to do so again. It was really pleasing for us to achieve this without having to continuously pass the user as a prop throughout all of our components or make repeated calls to the API to check the state of the user's favourites. 


**<ins>Filtering</ins>**

One of the biggest challenges we faced on this project was filtering our recipes using multiple filters.

 
<img src=Screenshots/FilteredRecipes1.png width=700> 
<img src=Screenshots/FilteredRecipes2.png width=700> 


From the screenshots above you can see that a user can search for a recipe based on category. Using the `react-select` library, we wanted users to be able to select multiple tags and for the options presented to be continuously refined based on all the selected tags. The example above shows the results for vegetarian dishes in the first image, whilst the second image shows the search further refined to show only pasta dishes that are vegetarian. 

Below is how we managed to implement this search:


In the `Recipes` component we make a single call to our API for all recipes. We then set this in state in two places `initialData` and `filteredData`


```js
const Recipes = () => {
  const [initialData, setInitialData] = useState([])
  const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState([])

  
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/api/recipes')
      .then(response => {
        setInitialData(response.data)
        setFilteredData([...response.data])
      })
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }, [])
	
```

We then have a `filterRecipes` function. It takes `tags` as an argument. Tags being the value of the items selected from the `react-select` object. If no tags are selected, the `filteredData` that is used in the return statement to be rendered is reset to be the same as the `initalData` that was set in state by the call to the API. 

```js

  function filterRecipes(tags) {
    if (tags.length === 0) {
      return setFilteredData([...initialData])
    }
    const types = tags.map(item => item.value)
    const recipes = initialData.filter((recipe) => {
      return types.every(element => recipe.category.includes(element))
    })
    setFilteredData(recipes)
  }
```

The reason that this filtering was originally a confusing problem for us was because recipes can have multiple categories, so we had to narrow down the options for the user to select from, rather than potentially having 20 categories that were all 'vegetarian'. 

We did this in the `FilteredRecipeForm` component by creating an array of all the categories attached to all of our recipes, flattening the data and creating a new array of only the unique values. 

```js
  const createTags = Recipes.map((recipe) => {
    return recipe.category
  })

  const tagsArray = createTags.flat()
  const allTags = [...new Set(tagsArray)]

  const allTagsLabeled = allTags.map((tag) => {
    return { value: tag, label: tag }
  })
```

**<ins>Email</ins>**

A fun feature we implemented was including the [Mailjet API](https://www.mailjet.com/) to email a shopping list of ingredients to a logged-in users registered email address.

The screenshots below show the 'Email me!' button and the notification using `react-toastify` notifying the user that an email has been sent. 

The code to implement sending the email is straightforward and simply follows Mailjet's basic template.

## <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="challenges">Challenges </span>

- As noted above, figuring out the logic to accurately filter our recipes and restaurants in stages was more difficult than we initially anticipated. Mapping through all of our recipes to extract categories to then return an array of unique categories didn't feel like the cleanest way of writing this code. Our models could very likely have been planned better, but this is perhaps also one of the negatives of using a noSQL database. 

- A lot of the logic utilised by the filtered recipe and filtered restaurant components is the very same. I believe this is not ideal practice when one of the best things about working with React is the ability to recycle components. Again, our models could likely have been more effectively structured to avoid repetitive-code. But ultimately, this project is a learning experience and was utterly invaluable for us to better understand building a MERN app. 


- This was our very first time working as a team whilst using Git to collaborate simultaneously on the same repo. Resolving merge conflicts was a time-consuming and nerve-wrangling experience! But was a very valuable learning experience and we remain firm friends.


## <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="successes">Successes </span>

- Overall this was a very enjoyable experience and we all gained a huge insight into building a MERN app and working collaboratively using Git. 

- Utilising React Hooks `useEffect`, `useState` and `useContext` for the first time. 

- The range and quality of the seed data for our database of recipes.

- Successfully implementing the filter feature was a really pleasing achievement for us. 

- The code was relatively simple to apply, but the shopping list email functionality is a featured we enjoyed including.


## <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="future">Potential Future Features </span>

- We'd like to make the app eventually look more like our initial idea and have the user experience focus more heavily on providing them with choice and then route them to different gastronomic suggestions based on time of day/how hungry they are/location. 

- The list of restaurants in the existing database is limited. We'd like to add to this. 


## <span style="font-family:Courier New" id="lessons">Lessons Learned </span>

- Write tests

- Plan models meticulously, with a focus on recycling front-end components effectively. 

- React Hooks are better than Class components
