## <span style="font-family:Courier New">Overview </span>

The Kitchen is a full-stack app that includes a RESTful API built with Express, MonogoDB and NodeJS and a React Front-end. 

The concept was to build an app that asked users if they wanted to dine-in or eat-out and then provide them with options based on the decision. 

The dine-in portion of the website allows users to search recipes from our database, it also allows logged in users to add their own recipes, much like a virtual recipe book and the user can also have shopping lists for each recipe emailed to their registered email address.

The eat-out section gives users details about London restaurants from our own database. 

Users also have a profile page which displays their favourite recipes and restaurants.

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
